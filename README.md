# How to install Rise of The Witch King on Apple Silicon

## Prerequisites
- Apple Silcon Mac (M1/2/3 chip). _Note: This was tested on a MacBook Pro 2021 M1 Max, Sonoma 14.5_
- Parallels Desktop running Windows 11. 

## Steps

1. Follow this guide (first for BFME2, then RoTWK): https://forums.revora.net/topic/105190-bfme1bfme2rotwk-games-download-installation-guide/?p=1028484
Note the following caveats:
    - Move all downloaded executables, files, etc., **outside the Downloads folder which is mirrored from MacOS!**. For example, move them directly into (a subfolder of) the C: drive of your Windows partition. 
    - Licence keys can also be found here: https://oldgamesdownload.com/the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii-the-rise-of-the-witch-king/
    - If you run into issues installing the Patch Switcher ("Setup Error! Could not read setup package!"), try this fix: https://www.gamereplays.org/community/index.php?s=&showtopic=1056718&view=findpost&p=10588561
2. Success!
